The general answer is no. 

More specifically, it depends on which database you are using.

While most database stored procedure languages would not allow the table name to be a variable, some have ways around this. 

For example, Oracle has "execute immediate", which allows you to execute a sql statement stored in a string.
So in a proc in Oracle PL/SQL you could do something like:

str_sql := 'select * from ' || tablename;
execute immediate(str_sql);
